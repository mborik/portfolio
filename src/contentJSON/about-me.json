    "content": "My humble beginnigs are dated into late 80s when I&nbsp;was boy who started learning the <b>BASIC</b> on Czechoslovakia produced micro-computer <b>PMD&nbsp;85</b>. After Velvet Revolution my older brother bought us an amazing <b>ZX-Spectrum+</b> and my interest in a&nbsp;computers has grown, so in the last years of elementary school I&nbsp;also learned <b>assembly language</b> of Zilog Z80 processor and I've started to do some beginner's experiments in it. Later then I've started with learning of C programming language while I&nbsp;was studying on vocational school focused on electrical engineering. I&nbsp;suppose that all this predestined my career."
