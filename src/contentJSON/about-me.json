After Velvet Revolution my older brother bought us an amazing <b>ZX-Spectrum+</b> and my interest in a&nbsp;computers has grown, so in the last years of elementary school I&nbsp;also learned <b>assembly language</b> of Zilog Z80 processor and I've started to do some beginner's experiments in it. Later then I've started with learning of C programming language while I&nbsp;was studying on vocational school focused on electrical engineering. I&nbsp;suppose that all this predestined my career."

    "content": "But my first steps into the professional IT were bit tough. I've never been such school-guy so altrough I've made a few humble attempts to study at university I dropped out after year or two because I didn't feel it helped me develop my career. Here you have to understand that I lived in the country of the former Ostblok in the 90s where no one will give you a chance in IT because you didn't study at university. Therefore I started to work as micro-electrician and then I got the opportunity in a design studio where I worked as a DTP graphic designer and set up a web development department here, step by step. This was a spark that ignited my career and it opened the way for me. I changed several jobs and a change came whenever I could fundamentally change technologies or workflows to always learn something new and keep a wide range of my knowledge."
